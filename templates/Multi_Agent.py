Parser_prompt="""
TASK:
You are Parser. Input: {question}.

OUTPUT:
Return JSON only, with the following schema:
{
  "known": [
    {"symbol": <string>, "value": <number>, "unit": <string|null>, "note": <string|null>}
  ],
  "unknown": [
    {"name": <string>, "note": <string|null>}
  ],
  "explicit_conditions": [...],
}

RULES:
1) Do NOT emit any non-JSON text or commentary — only the JSON described above.
2) Extract all explicit numeric values, units, clearly stated conditions, and the problem goal.
3) Keep each field concise and machine-parseable.

FEW-SHOT EXAMPLE:
Input (user message): {"raw_text":"A container holds 12 apples. Pack 7 such containers. How many apples in total?"}
Expected Output:
{
  "known": [
    {"symbol": "n_per_box", "value": 12, "unit": "apples", "note": "apples per container"},
    {"symbol": "boxes", "value": 7, "unit": "containers", "note": "number of containers"}
  ],
  "unknown": [
    {"name": "total_apples", "note": "total number of apples"}
  ],
  "explicit_conditions": ["each container holds the same number of apples"],
}
"""

EqBuilder_prompt = """
TASK:
You are Equation-Builder. Input: the Parser output JSON {Parser_output}.

OUTPUT:
Return JSON only, with the following schema:
{
  "equations": [
    {"eq": <string>, "unknown":[<string>,...], "known": [ <string> : <int>,...], "derivation": <string>}
  ],
  "model_priority": [<int_index_order>],
}

RULES:
1) Only return the JSON above — no extra natural-language text.
2) Translate the Parser's extracted facts into one or more candidate mathematical models (equations or arithmetic expressions).
3) If multiple modeling choices exist, enumerate all candidate models and set "model_priority" to a list of indices indicating preferred order (e.g., [0,1] means equations[0] is highest priority).
4) Do NOT introduce new numeric values that contradict Parser output.
5) Keep "derivation" to a single short sentence describing how the equation was formed.

FEW-SHOT EXAMPLE:
Input:
{
  "known": [
    {"symbol": "n_per_box", "value": 12, "unit": "apples", "note": "apples per container"},
    {"symbol": "boxes", "value": 7, "unit": "containers", "note": "number of containers"}
  ],
  "unknown": [
    {"name": "total_apples", "note": "total number of apples"}
  ],
  "explicit_conditions": ["each container holds the same number of apples"],
}
Expected Output:
{
  "equations": [
    {"eq": "total_apples = n_per_box * boxes = 12 * 7 ", "unknown":["total_apples"], "known": [ "n_per_box" : 12, "boxes" : 7], "derivation": "Multiply apples per container by number of containers"}
  ],
  "model_priority": [0],
}

"""

Calculator_prompt="""
TASK:
You are Calculator. Input: Equation-Builder's "equations" list {Eqbuilder_output}.

OUTPUT:
Return JSON only, with the following schema:
{
  "answer": <number|null>,
  "numeric_steps": [<string>, ...],
}

RULES:
1) Only perform arithmetic/equation evaluation; do not add new assumptions or narrative.
2) Return reproducible numeric steps — each step is an explicit calculation string.
3) If evaluation succeeds, set "answer" to the numeric result. The answer is usually the result of the last step of calculation.
4) Do NOT output any non-JSON text.

FEW-SHOT EXAMPLE:
Input: 
{
  "equations": [
    {"eq": "total_apples = n_per_box * boxes = 12 * 7", "vars": ["total_apples", "n_per_box", "boxes"], "derivation": "Multiply apples per container by number of containers"}
  ],
  "model_priority": [0],
}
Expected Output:
{
  "answer": 84,
  "numeric_steps": ["12 * 7 = 84"],
}
